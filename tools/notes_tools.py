"""Project-notes tools — let the agent read/write the operator console's Notes
panel tabs, respecting each tab's per-tab ``agentRead`` / ``agentWrite``
permission toggles.

The Notes panel persists a workspace at ``<project>/.automaker/notes/workspace.json``
(see ``operator_api/notes.py``). Each tab carries
``permissions: {agentRead, agentWrite}`` — the operator decides which tabs the
agent may see or edit. These tools are the bridge that makes those toggles
mean something; without them the agent can't see the operator's notes at all
(it would otherwise confuse them with its private ``memory_*`` store).

The project defaults to the server's working directory (the repo root the Notes
panel shows by default); pass ``project_path`` to target another project.
