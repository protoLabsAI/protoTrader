"""ToolDeferralMiddleware — progressive tool disclosure (ADR 0005 #3).

When the agent is wired with many tools (notably a large MCP catalog), every
bound tool's name + description + JSON schema is sent to the model on *every*
turn. Past ~10–15 tools that burns context and degrades tool selection ("tool
pollution"). This middleware withholds most tool *schemas* from the model while
keeping every tool *callable*:

- ``create_agent`` still receives the full tool list, so the ToolNode can
  execute any tool — deferral never breaks execution.
- At the ``wrap_model_call`` boundary (the only place that sees the final
  ModelRequest), we trim ``request.tools`` to a small **base** set plus whatever
  the agent has *loaded* by calling ``search_tools``.

"Loaded" is read straight from the message history: ``search_tools`` returns its
matches as a backticked bulleted list, so the names it surfaced are recoverable
from its ToolMessages — no extra state channel, and it survives summarization as
long as those messages do. Once surfaced, a tool stays available for the rest of
the thread.

OFF by default (the middleware is only added when ``tools.deferred.enabled``);
when off, the full tool set reaches the model exactly as before.
