"""Tests for graph.output_format — <scratch_pad>/<output> protocol.

Covers the three shapes of traffic we see live:

1. Well-behaved model — emits both tags in the documented order.
2. Mixed — emits `<scratch_pad>` but forgets `<output>` wrapper.
3. Native thinking — provider (MiniMax, DeepSeek, Qwen3) leaks
   `<think>...</think>` regions that the filter must also strip.

The one-shot terminal path runs the complete text through ``extract_output``.
The incremental path (``stream_visible_output``) streams the user-facing
``<output>`` region token-by-token without leaking ``<scratch_pad>``; the
terminal ``extract_output`` reconciles any held-back tail. Both are covered.
