#
# Lifecycle note: without an explicit mount, Docker creates an
# ANONYMOUS volume on every ``docker run``. Those accumulate and the
# volume is NOT removed when the container is removed unless you pass
# ``--rm -v``. For long-lived deployments, use a named volume or a
# host mount so upgrades don't silently carry stale config forward:
#
#   docker run -v my-agent-config:/opt/protoagent/config my-agent:latest
#
# or a bind mount:
#
#   docker run -v /srv/my-agent/config:/opt/protoagent/config my-agent:latest
