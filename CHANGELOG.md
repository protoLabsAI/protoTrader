# Changelog

All notable changes to protoAgent are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Add your entries under [Unreleased]** in your PR. When a release is cut,
> `prepare-release.yml` rolls them into a dated, versioned section via
> `scripts/changelog.py`. See [Releasing](docs/guides/releasing.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- MCP per-server tool allowlist (`tools.include` / `tools.exclude`) and lazy
  `enabled: false` connect, bounding the per-turn tool-schema footprint
  (ADR 0005 #1).
- Skills surface their declared `tools:` to the agent as `<relevant_tools>`
  when retrieved — a relevance hint, not a gate (ADR 0005 #2).
- Opt-in deferred tools + a `search_tools` meta-tool for progressive tool
  disclosure at high tool counts (`tools.deferred`, ADR 0005 #3).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), following Keep a Changelog.

### Changed
- Releases are now cut **manually** via `workflow_dispatch` (choose
  patch/minor/major) instead of auto-bumping on every merge to `main`.
- `main` is protected by a repository ruleset: a PR and the three CI checks
  (Verify workspace config, Python tests, Web E2E smoke) are required to merge.

### Docs
- ADR 0005 — Tool Pollution & Progressive Tool Disclosure.
- Releasing runbook (`docs/guides/releasing.md`).
