## 1. Context & Problem Statement

To refine cost and latency we first have to *see* them, reliably, at the right
granularity. An audit of what protoAgent captures today:

### What exists (good bones)

| Capability | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Langfuse tracing (session + tool spans, trace-id on audit lines) | `tracing.py` | Working; graceful no-op when unconfigured |
| Prometheus `/metrics` (per-fork namespaced) | `metrics.py`, `server.py` | Endpoint up; **LLM metrics defined but unused** |
| Per-tool latency + success → JSONL + Langfuse + Prometheus | `graph/middleware/audit.py` | Working |
| Per-LLM-call token capture (`on_chat_model_end`, `stream_usage=True`) | `server.py` `_run_turn_stream`, `graph/llm.py` | Working (input/output only) |
| Outbound `cost-v1` DataPart on the terminal A2A artifact | `a2a_handler.py` (`COST_MIME`, `_cost_payload`) | Working (usage + durationMs; `costUsd` omitted) |

### The gaps (what blocks the flywheel)

1. **`metrics.record_llm_call` is defined but never called** (`metrics.py`).
   The `*_llm_calls_total`, `*_llm_latency_seconds`, `*_llm_tokens_total` series
   are dead — the LLM half of any dashboard is empty. Only `record_tool_call`
   fires (from `AuditMiddleware`).
2. **No USD cost.** `costUsd` is deliberately omitted; there's no pricing table.
   Every consumer recomputes from tokens + its own rates.
3. **No prompt-cache tokens.** `usage_metadata.input_token_details` (cache_read
   / cache_creation) isn't read. Prompt caching is **on** — so we pay for the
   cache and can't see the savings or the hit ratio.
4. **No per-LLM-call latency.** Only whole-task wall-clock duration is computed
   (from `created_at`→`updated_at`).
5. **No historical store.** Prometheus is live-scrape-only (and missing the LLM
   data); `AuditMiddleware`'s session stats die on restart. Nothing inside
   protoAgent can answer "what was expensive/slow last week."
6. **The operator console shows none of it** — no tokens/cost/latency anywhere.
7. **No feedback loop.** Nothing turns telemetry into action.

## 2. The flywheel (target)

```
   ┌────────── measure ──────────┐
   │  per-call tokens (incl cache)│
   │  per-call + per-tool latency │
   │  USD cost, model, turn rollup│
   └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                  ▼
            persist + aggregate  (local store: per-turn / per-call rollups)
                  ▼
              surface  (operator console: $/turn, p50/p95, cache-hit %)
                  ▼
            optimize + feed back  (flag expensive/slow turns; prove the levers —
              prompt cache, tool deferral, compaction, model routing; feed
              signal into learned-skills / memory / operator recommendations)
                  ▲
                  └──────────── measure again ───────────┘
```

The levers already exist (prompt cache, `tools.deferred`, compaction,
routing/fallback). What's missing is the *measurement* that proves they work
and the *loop* that points them where they're needed.

## 3. Decision

Instrument at the seams the audit found; **don't** rebuild the backbone. Align
outbound telemetry with the fleet so the data is useful beyond protoAgent.

1. **Capture is per-LLM-call**, in `_run_turn_stream`'s `astream_events` loop —
   the only place with per-call visibility (a task may hit the model N times).
   Add cache tokens + per-call latency + the model name to what's already
   captured there.
2. **Cost is computed in-process** from a pricing table (`pricing.py`), cache-
   aware, and emitted as `costUsd` — making protoAgent the source of truth for
   its own cost rather than every consumer re-deriving it.
3. **Wire the dead metrics**: call `record_llm_call` per call; extend it with
   cache tokens + cost; add the missing series.
4. **Align with Workstacean's `cost-v1` A2A extension** (see §5) — emit the
   Anthropic-shaped cache fields it already expects, populate `costUsd`, and
   **declare the extension URI in the agent card** so the integration is
   explicit, not incidental.
5. **Persist + surface + close the loop** in later slices (§4).

## 4. Ranked Plan (slices)

1. ✅ **Measure (foundation) — ships with this ADR.** Capture cache tokens +
   per-call latency + model in `_run_turn_stream`; add `pricing.py` → `costUsd`
   (base input/output rates, fleet-consistent; cache-discounted cost deferred
   until gateway token semantics are validated); wire `record_llm_call`
   (extended with cache + cost series). Per-call **Langfuse** generation spans
   already come from the LiteLLM gateway callback — we deliberately *don't* add
   a manual shim that would bypass `trace_session`'s nesting (guarded by
   `test_no_legacy_shims_exist`). Emit cache fields + `costUsd` on `cost-v1` and
   declare the extension URI in the card. *(fixes 1–4)*
2. ✅ **Persist & aggregate — shipped.** `telemetry_store.py` (`TelemetryStore`)
   writes one per-turn row (tokens incl. cache, cost, duration, LLM/tool call
   counts, model, outcome) at the single terminal chokepoint
   (`A2ATaskStore.update_state`), instance-scoped (ADR 0004). Read via
   `/api/telemetry/summary` (totals, success rate, cache-hit ratio, p50/p95
   latency, per-model split) + `/api/telemetry/recent`. Survives restart; no TTL
   (history is the substrate), `prune()` available. *(fixes 5)*
3. ✅ **Surface — shipped.** A **System ▸ Telemetry** dashboard
   (`apps/web/src/telemetry/TelemetrySurface.tsx`): summary cards (cost, turns,
   success rate, cache-hit %, p50/p95 latency, tokens, tool calls) + a by-model
   table + a recent-turns table, reading `/api/telemetry/*`. Functional-first
   (theme-consistent, no charts yet — a follow-up). *(fixes 6)*
4. ✅ **Flywheel / feedback — shipped (advise-only).** `/api/telemetry/insights`
   + a Telemetry **Insights** panel: flags turns whose cost/latency ≥ 5× the
   rolling median, and *proves the levers we can measure from the per-turn
   store* — prompt-cache hit % + estimated USD saved (`pricing.cache_read_savings_usd`),
   plus model-mix (routing visibility). **Read-only**: it surfaces signal, the
   operator decides — no autonomous config changes. Levers needing extra
   per-turn signals (tool-deferral schema-token savings, compaction, detailed
   routing) are explicitly listed as *not yet measured* rather than faked — a
   follow-up that adds those signals can light them up. *(fixes 7)*

   **Slice 4b (per-turn signals)** then made two of those levers real: the
   telemetry row records the **actual model(s)** used per turn (`model` =
   primary, `models` = distinct set), so routing — incl. aux/fallback models —
   is proven per turn rather than stamped from the configured lead; and
   `ToolDeferralMiddleware` emits `*_llm_tools_deferred_total` to Prometheus,
   proving the deferral lever live. Compaction remains the one unproven lever
   (needs a `SummarizationMiddleware` hook) — honestly surfaced as such.

> **Why advise-only (not auto-optimize).** Letting telemetry change config
> automatically (auto-enable deferral, auto-downgrade model) is higher leverage
> but needs guardrails and risks surprising regressions. We start by making the
> signal trustworthy and visible; auto-optimization is a deliberate future step,
> not a default.

Priorities (per the kickoff): **cost visibility ($)** and **latency breakdown**
lead; Slice 1 makes both real. The console surface (Slice 3) follows so the
numbers are visible, then the loop (Slice 4).

## 5. Alignment: Workstacean's `cost-v1` A2A extension

protoAgent already emits a `cost-v1` DataPart; Workstacean already consumes one.
This ADR closes the remaining gaps so they meet the *same* contract.

- **Extension URI:** `https://proto-labs.ai/a2a/ext/cost-v1`
  (`protoWorkstacean/src/executor/extensions/cost.ts` `COST_URI`;
  `docs/extensions/cost-v1.md`). protoAgent will **declare it in the agent
  card's `capabilities.extensions`**, which is what gates Workstacean's cost
  interceptor (`ExtensionRegistry.interceptorsFor(card)`).
- **DataPart MIME:** `application/vnd.protolabs.cost-v1+json` (already matches).
- **`usage` shape** (Workstacean `lib/types/cost-v1.ts` `CostArtifactUsage`):
  `{ input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens?,
  cache_read_input_tokens? }` — Anthropic-shaped. **We don't emit the cache
  fields yet; Slice 1 adds them.**
- **`costUsd`** — Workstacean's interceptor uses our `costUsd` when present and
  only falls back to `tokens × MODEL_RATES` when it's absent. Emitting it makes
  us authoritative and sidesteps cache-discount mismatch (their `MODEL_RATES`
  in `lib/types/budget.ts` carries input/output only, no cache tiers).
- **Rates:** `pricing.py` mirrors the structure + overlapping values of
  Workstacean's `MODEL_RATES` and adds Anthropic cache multipliers
  (cache-read ≈ 0.1× input, cache-write ≈ 1.25× input). Both sides agree on the
  base rates; protoAgent's emitted `costUsd` is the cache-accurate number.
- **Consumer fields** (`docs/extensions/cost-v1.md`): the interceptor records a
  `CostSample` and publishes `autonomous.cost.{actor}.{skill}` for the planner's
  cost/confidence ranking and the fleet cost-per-outcome dashboard. So better
  protoAgent telemetry directly improves fleet-level planning — the flywheel
  isn't only local.

> Note: Workstacean's cost store is **observational, in-memory** (last 200
> samples/key), explicitly *not billing*. protoAgent's Slice 2 local store is
> the durable, queryable half on our side; the two are complementary.

## 6. Consequences

**Positive**
- Real per-call/per-turn cost + latency, with cache visibility — the data the
  flywheel runs on, and proof that the existing optimization levers work.
- Fleet alignment: one `cost-v1` contract; protoAgent's numbers feed
  Workstacean's planner + dashboards directly.
- Reuses the existing backbone (Langfuse/Prometheus/audit) — incremental, not a
  rewrite.

**Negative / costs**
- A pricing table is a maintenance surface — model rates drift; it must track
  the gateway (documented; falls back to a `default` rate, never crashes).
- Cache-token fidelity depends on the gateway surfacing
  `prompt_tokens_details` / `input_token_details` (OpenAI-compat exposes
  `cached_tokens`; Anthropic cache-creation may not round-trip through every
  gateway). Captured best-effort, defaulting to 0.
- Per-call instrumentation adds a little work to the hot streaming loop — kept
  cheap (counters + a contextvar), and all of it no-ops when
  Langfuse/Prometheus aren't configured.

## 7. Alternatives Considered

- **Lean entirely on Langfuse/Prometheus, no local store.** Good for live ops,
  but Langfuse is opt-in/external and Prometheus is scrape-windowed — neither
  gives protoAgent a queryable history for the flywheel. Local store (Slice 2)
  complements them, doesn't replace them.
- **Let consumers compute cost (status quo).** Keeps protoAgent rate-free but
  every consumer re-derives cost, no one sees cache savings, and the console
  can't show `$`. Rejected — emitting `costUsd` once, cache-aware, is the right
  source of truth.
- **A new bespoke telemetry DataPart.** Rejected — `cost-v1` already exists and
  is consumed fleet-wide; we conform to it rather than fork it.
