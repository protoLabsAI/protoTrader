# Extensions

A2A extensions the template implements. Each is either emitted, parsed, or both.

## `cost-v1`

**URI**: `https://protolabs.ai/a2a/ext/cost-v1`
**Direction**: emitted by this agent
**Declared on card**: yes (by default)

Every terminal task carries a DataPart with token usage and duration:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "usage": {
      "input_tokens": 1200,
      "output_tokens": 340,
      "total_tokens": 1540
    },
    "durationMs": 4230
  }
}
```

Captured by the `on_chat_model_end` handler in `_chat_langgraph_stream`. Requires `stream_usage=True` on the ChatOpenAI client — the template sets this in `graph/llm.py`.

**Consumers** (like Workstacean's A2AExecutor) extract this DataPart onto `result.data` and record per-(agent, skill) samples. The consumer keys on the `skill` ID from the card, so skill IDs must be stable.

`costUsd` is not captured today — deriving it from model rates is a follow-up. Consumers tolerate missing `costUsd` and can compute it from `usage` themselves.

## `confidence-v1`

**URI**: `https://proto-labs.ai/a2a/ext/confidence-v1`
**mimeType**: `application/vnd.protolabs.confidence-v1+json`
**Direction**: emitted by this agent
**Declared on card**: yes (by default)

When the model self-reports a `<confidence>` tag in its final output, the terminal task carries a DataPart with the score:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "success": true,
    "confidenceExplanation": "two consistent sources agreed"
  }
}
```

The model emits the tags after `</output>` (see the protocol in `graph/output_format.py::OUTPUT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS`); the server parses them with `extract_confidence()` and the A2A handler records them via `set_confidence()`, clamping to `[0, 1]`. The DataPart is omitted entirely when the model didn't report a score. `success` reflects the terminal state (`COMPLETED` only) — a high `confidence` on a non-success run is the "high-confidence failure" calibration signal.

## `effect-domain-v1`

**URI**: `https://protolabs.ai/a2a/ext/effect-domain-v1`
**Direction**: declared by this agent
**Declared on card**: no (template has no mutating skills)

Advertises per-skill world-state mutations so Workstacean's L1 planner can rank your agent against goals that target those state selectors.

```json
{
  "uri": "https://protolabs.ai/a2a/ext/effect-domain-v1",
  "params": {
    "skills": {
      "file_bug": {
        "effects": [{
          "domain": "protomaker_board",
          "path": "data.backlog_count",
          "delta": 1,
          "confidence": 0.9
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `domain` | World-state selector domain the mutation targets |
| `path` | Dotted path within the domain |
| `delta` | Signed numeric delta (positive = increase) |
| `confidence` | 0–1 prior for the planner's ranking model |

Only declare effects that actually mutate shared state. Over-declaring confuses the planner into routing your agent for goals it can't move.

**Pair with runtime emission**: if you declare an effect, emit a matching `worldstate-delta-v1` DataPart when the tool succeeds at runtime (see `a2a_handler.py::TaskRecord.world_deltas`). Divergence between declared and observed mutations breaks the planner's scoring model.

See `docs/extensions/effect-domain-v1` in the [protoWorkstacean repo](https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoWorkstacean) for the full spec.

## `worldstate-delta-v1`

**URI**: (runtime artifact only, not a card extension)
**Direction**: emitted when tools with declared effects succeed
**Declared on card**: n/a

Emitted as a DataPart on the terminal artifact:

```json
{
  "mime": "application/vnd.protolabs.worldstate-delta-v1+json",
  "data": {
    "deltas": [{
      "domain": "protomaker_board",
      "path": "data.backlog_count",
      "op": "inc",
      "value": 1
    }]
  }
}
```

The template doesn't emit this by default because the shipped tools don't mutate anything. See `a2a_handler.py::TaskRecord.add_delta` for where to hook in.

## `skill-v1`

**URI / mimeType**: `application/vnd.protolabs.skill-v1+json`
**Direction**: emitted by this agent (when subagents opt in)
**Declared on card**: no (runtime artifact, not a card capability)

Captures the "recipe" of a successful subagent workflow so future runs can reuse it. Emitted as a DataPart on the terminal artifact of any task that called `task(..., emit_skill=True)` when the subagent's config has `allow_skill_emission: true`:

```json
{
  "kind": "data",
  "metadata": {"mimeType": "application/vnd.protolabs.skill-v1+json"},
  "data": {
    "name": "refactor-memory-load",
    "description": "Rewrites KnowledgeMiddleware.load_memory() to enforce a token budget",
    "prompt_template": "You are the memory subagent. Given {{target_file}} and {{budget}}, ...",
    "tools_used": ["read_file", "write_file", "run_tests"],
    "created_at": "2026-04-19T17:24:36.860Z",
    "source_session_id": "session-abc123"
  }
}
```

Fields:

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `name` | Short human-readable label used as the FTS5 search key |
| `description` | What the skill does; primary retrieval surface |
| `prompt_template` | The prompt that drove the original successful run, reusable verbatim or with variable substitution |
| `tools_used` | Tool names actually invoked — proxy for which subagent type would run this skill |
| `created_at` | UTC ISO timestamp |
| `source_session_id` | Provenance — which session produced the artifact |

**Collection** — `a2a_handler.py` reads skills from the `_pending_skills` ContextVar at task completion and appends them as DataParts. Agents and middleware never access the ContextVar directly; they use `emit_skill_artifact()` to add and `get_pending_skills()` to read.

**Indexing** — protoAgent's own `SkillsIndex` (`graph/skills/index.py`) at `/sandbox/skills.db` picks these up on the next sweep and makes them retrievable by `KnowledgeMiddleware.load_skills(query)`. Consumers running their own skill registries can index the DataParts from the A2A stream directly — the mimeType is the contract.

**Why ContextVar and not a state field** — skill emission happens inside LangGraph's tool loop, potentially from async tool execution frames that don't see the top-level state object. ContextVars propagate across async boundaries without threading state through every call site.

See [architecture § Skill loop](/explanation/architecture#skill-loop) for the rationale and [skill loop tutorial](/tutorials/skill-loop) for the walkthrough.

## `a2a.trace` — distributed Langfuse propagation

**Not an extension**, a protocol convention. Lives in `params.metadata`, not `capabilities.extensions`.

**Direction**: parsed by this agent (incoming)

When the caller stamps their trace context:

```json
{
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {...},
    "metadata": {
      "a2a.trace": {
        "traceId": "abc123",
        "spanId": "def456"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent reads it in `a2a_handler.py` and stamps `caller_trace_id` + `caller_span_id` into its own Langfuse trace metadata. Operators can then filter Langfuse by `metadata.caller_trace_id` to find every agent trace spawned from a single dispatch.

## Adding a new extension

1. Emit or parse in `a2a_handler.py` / `server.py`.
2. Declare on the card under `capabilities.extensions` with a URI consumers agree on.
3. Document the shape in this file.
4. Add a test to `tests/test_a2a_integration.py` asserting the declaration is present on the card.
