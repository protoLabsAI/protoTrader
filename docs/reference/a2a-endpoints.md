# A2A endpoints

Every endpoint the A2A handler exposes. Served on port 7870 by default.

## Well-known paths

| Path | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` | The agent card as JSON |
| `GET /.well-known/agent.json` | Alias for the card; some clients expect this path |

Both paths return identical content. Serving both is a spec compatibility hedge — early A2A clients (including older `@a2a-js/sdk` versions) probed different paths.

## JSON-RPC methods (POST /a2a)

All methods use JSON-RPC 2.0 envelopes:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "<caller-chosen>",
  "method": "<name>",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

### `message/send` — blocking

Submit a message and wait for the terminal task. Returns the full Task object including artifacts.

```json
{
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [{"text": "summarize https://example.com"}]
    },
    "metadata": {"skill": "summarize_pr"}
  }
}
```

Result shape:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "kind": "task",
    "id": "<task-id>",
    "contextId": "<ctx-id>",
    "status": {"state": "completed"},
    "artifacts": [...],
    "data": {
      "usage": {"input_tokens": 1200, "output_tokens": 340, "total_tokens": 1540},
      "durationMs": 4230
    }
  }
}
```

The `kind: "task"` discriminator is required — `@a2a-js/sdk` routes by it.

### `message/stream` — SSE

Same as `message/send` but streams frames as the run progresses. One SSE event per frame. Every frame carries a `kind` discriminator:

| `kind` | When emitted |
|---|---|
| `task` | First frame — initial task state |
| `status-update` | State transitions, tool-start / tool-end progress, and the `input-required` pause (with `final: true`) |
| `artifact-update` | Streaming partial outputs |

Consumers must check `kind` before interpreting fields — without it, `@a2a-js/sdk`'s `for await` loop silently skips frames.

### `tasks/get`

```json
{"method": "tasks/get", "params": {"id": "<task-id>"}}
```

Returns the current state of a task. Use to poll when push notifications aren't wired.

Task records are **persisted** (instance-scoped `a2a-tasks.db`, 24h TTL,
write-through on create + every terminal transition), so `tasks/get` and
`tasks/resubscribe` answer with the final state + artifacts even after the
in-memory copy is evicted (1h) or the process restarts. The background *runner*
doesn't survive a restart, so any task still non-terminal at boot is marked
`failed` ("interrupted by server restart") rather than left hanging.

### `tasks/resubscribe`

```json
{"method": "tasks/resubscribe", "params": {"id": "<task-id>"}}
```

SSE stream of remaining frames for an in-flight task. Lets a consumer reconnect after a network blip without losing events.

### Human-in-the-loop (`input-required`)

The agent can pause mid-task to ask the operator a question — the spec's
`input-required` flow (ADR 0003). It's driven by the lead-agent **`ask_human`**
tool, which issues a LangGraph `interrupt()`; the graph checkpoints at that exact
point.

1. The task transitions to **`input-required`** — a `status-update` whose
   `status.message` carries the question, with `final: true`, closing the SSE
   cycle. The task is **not** terminal; it's parked (and persisted, so it
   survives a restart). Webhook consumers get an immediate (un-throttled) push.
2. The caller answers by sending a **`message/send`** (or `message/stream`)
   carrying the **same `taskId`** (and `contextId`) with the reply as a text
   part. protoAgent resumes the graph via `Command(resume=…)` from the
   checkpoint — continuing exactly where `ask_human` paused — and drives to a
   terminal state (or another `input-required`).

```json
{"method": "message/stream", "params": {
  "message": {"taskId": "<parked-task-id>", "contextId": "<ctx>",
              "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "approved"}]}}}
```

A message with no `taskId` (or one that isn't `input-required`) starts a fresh
task as usual. The card advertises support via the `hitl-mode-v1` extension.

### `tasks/cancel`

```json
{"method": "tasks/cancel", "params": {"id": "<task-id>"}}
```

Transitions the task to `canceled` if it's still running. No-op on terminal tasks.

### `agent/getAuthenticatedExtendedCard`

```json
{"method": "agent/getAuthenticatedExtendedCard", "params": {}}
```

Returns the agent card to an authenticated caller (the request has already
passed the bearer/api-key check). Same shape as the public
`/.well-known/agent-card.json`.

### `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/{set,get,list,delete}`

Register webhooks so a non-streaming consumer is kept updated as work
progresses. The agent POSTs to the webhook on **every meaningful transition the
caller cares about** — the initial `working`, each per-tool progress step, and
the terminal state — mirroring what SSE subscribers see. Non-terminal updates
are **throttled** to at most one POST per ~1.5s (carrying the latest state) so a
burst of tool events can't storm the webhook; terminal transitions flush
immediately. The COMPLETED webhook also carries the terminal `artifact`.

```json
{
  "method": "tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set",
  "params": {
    "taskId": "<task-id>",
    "pushNotificationConfig": {
      "url": "https://consumer/callback/abc",
      "token": "shared-secret"
    }
  }
}
```

The handler accepts both token shapes the A2A spec permits:

| Shape | JSON |
|---|---|
| Top-level `token` (what `@a2a-js/sdk` serializes by default) | `{"url": "...", "token": "..."}` |
| Structured `authentication.credentials` (RFC-8821) | `{"url": "...", "authentication": {"schemes": ["Bearer"], "credentials": "..."}}` |

Both produce `Authorization: Bearer <token>` **and** the spec-canonical
`X-A2A-Notification-Token: <token>` header on outgoing webhook POSTs, so a
strict receiver can validate the notification belongs to a config it created.
When both token shapes are present, top-level wins.

Webhook payload: a `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` (the same envelope as the matching
SSE `status-update` frame); the terminal/COMPLETED POST attaches the full
`artifact`. Delivery retries 3× with exponential backoff (1s/3s/9s), skipping
retry on 4xx.

Registered configs are **persisted** (write-through to an instance-scoped
`a2a-push.db`, 24h TTL) so they survive the task's terminal eviction and a
process restart.

## REST aliases

Thin REST wrappers are also exposed for non-JSON-RPC clients:

| Method + Path | Equivalent to |
|---|---|
| `POST /a2a/tasks/:taskId/pushNotificationConfig` | `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set` |
| `GET /a2a/tasks/:taskId/pushNotificationConfig` | `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/list` |
| `GET /a2a/tasks/:taskId` | `tasks/get` |

Same semantics, same token-shape parsing, same SSRF guarding.

## SSRF guard

Outgoing webhook URLs are resolved once and checked against an allowlist before the handler accepts a push config. By default, private IP ranges (RFC1918 + loopback + link-local) are refused.

To permit trusted docker-network hostnames, set:

```bash
PUSH_NOTIFICATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS=workstacean,automaker-server
PUSH_NOTIFICATION_ALLOWED_CIDRS=10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12
```

Hosts in `PUSH_NOTIFICATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS` bypass the DNS check entirely.

## Extension advertisement

The card's `capabilities.extensions` array declares protocol extensions the agent implements. See [Extensions reference](/reference/extensions) for the ones the template ships.
