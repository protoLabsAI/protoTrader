    When ``allowed_dirs`` is provided, the resolved path must be equal to
    or nested under one of those directories. This is the operator-console
    sandbox: the React client sends a free-text ``project_path``, so the
    server — not the client — decides which directories beads/notes may
    touch. ``None`` means "no allowlist configured" and stays permissive
    so non-operator callers and tests keep the old behavior.

    Resolution happens before the containment check (``Path.resolve`` walks
    symlinks and normalizes ``..``), so neither ``../../etc`` nor a symlink
    pointing outside an allowed root can escape the sandbox.
